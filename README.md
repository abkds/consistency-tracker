# Consistency Tracker

This repository tracks daily consistency across:
- Office ML work
- Focused study (HOML3, Karpathy, Papers)
- Physical activity

Philosophy:
- Presence > intensity
- Rest days are valid
- Missed days are neutral
- This is a long-term log, not a scorecard

No charts or analysis for now.
Those can be added later once enough data exists.
